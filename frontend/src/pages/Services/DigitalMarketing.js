              Social media marketing (SMM) is a form of Internet marketing that
              utilizes social networking websites as a marketing tool. The goal
              of SMM is to produce content that users will share with their
              social network to help a company increase brand exposure and
              broaden customer reach.
            </p>

            <p>
              One of the key components of SMM is social media optimization
              (SMO). Like search engine optimization (SEO), SMO is a strategy
              for drawing new and unique visitors to a website. SMO can be done
              two ways: adding social media links to content, such as RSS feeds
              and sharing buttons â€” or promoting activity through social media
              by updating statuses or tweets, or blog posts.
